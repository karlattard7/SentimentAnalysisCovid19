# Sentiment Analysis on COVID-19 Vaccine Uptake in Europe

The proposed idea for the IAPT project is to perform **sentiment analysis** on a collection of tweets related to **COVID-19 vaccine uptake** across Europe.

## Objective

The main goal is to compare public sentiment **before and after** the announcement that blood clots were confirmed as a **rare side effect** of a specific COVID-19 vaccine. This analysis aims to assess how this event influenced people's opinions and emotions regarding the vaccine, focusing on three countries:

- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Great Britain  
- ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ Italy  
- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spain

---

## Methodology

- The **Twitter API** was used to collect relevant tweets.
- Initial effort was spent understanding how to use the API effectively for data collection.
- Sentiment classification was performed using an existing **Sentiment Analysis library**, categorizing each tweet as:
  - Positive
  - Neutral
  - Negative

---

## Analysis & Visualization

The relationship between tweet sentiment and vaccine uptake in each country will be analyzed using:

- **Bar charts** to show sentiment distribution over time
- **Word clouds** to highlight commonly used words
- A **pie chart** to summarize overall sentiment proportions
